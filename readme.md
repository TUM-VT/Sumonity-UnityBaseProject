## installation

### Repo Setup

Make sure to have the ssh key of this machine your are working on added to your account.

Use Git Bash for the setup of the repo, otherwise vcs tools will not work

install vcs tools:
```
pip install vcstool2
```

IMPORTANT: Check for warnings regarding the PATH variable. 

get submodules
```
vcs import < assets.repos

```



### Sumo Python Envrionment Setup

The prompts in this guide refer to git bash and not "powershell" or "cmd"

Go to The Sumo Folder where the python script for "TraCI" is located:

Setup the envrionment
```
cd Assets/SumoBridge/Sumo
```

Install the virtualenvironment toolset
```
pip install virtualenv 
```

Enable execution of scripts, open powershell in admin mode:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```


Activate it and install dependencies:
```
virtualenv venv
source ./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


Hint if you run into issues, try to do this part in powershell
